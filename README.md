# simple_alert_telegram

this is simple tools to monitoring cpu usage and if usage of the cpu is more than the threshold 

All you need is :
- Get your token in telegram bot you can refer to this link to configure telegram bot https://dev.to/rizkyrajitha/get-notifications-with-telegram-bot-537l
- after that you just need to configure cronjob, because this is simple script i think 10 minutes will be enough
